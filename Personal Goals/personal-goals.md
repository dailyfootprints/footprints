# Personal Goals

Personal goals for accountability!

Now, I am not really one to keeping a log of what I wish to achieve, therefore, I'm not going to log each week
the various tasks and goals I have in mind. Rest Assured that I do have a plan. Me thinks it would be more fun to let it be self-unleashed. That said, I shall endeavor to do a post hindsight debrief, if time allows. What would that look like? Basically, that which you'll see would be what I'd have already done and later make a list and check them off as they are already completed, since hindsight is 20/20 and this is 20-18, maybe I shall work up to a forward looking tasks list, that I shall reveal as I plan ahead and conversely, put on display what I have not (yet) gotten around to, and will therefore shift the items which shall be respectively added to the list for the next and upcoming weeks.

* **[History ðŸ‘µðŸ‘´](history.md#history)**

## Goals for 2018:

* JavaScript - learn it (simples!) :sunglasses:
* Complete freeCodeCamp [beta] (:fire:)
  * possibly re start in a 100 days of code fashion

**Things I'll do in the Future:**

These tasks will be picked off of this list and added to the weekly tasks lists
when I feel that I can complete them. [which basically means do before I'm
distracted by the next new shiny]
